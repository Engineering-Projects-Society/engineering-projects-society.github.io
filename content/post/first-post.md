Hey! Nice to have you here on my blog.

I created this blog to document all the smaller and sometimes a little bigger projects I work on in my free time.
This will also serve as a *devlog* of some sort for my current project, [magma](https://github.com/RedNicStone/magma), and it's integration with meachnetia.

Expect many project updates and C++ ramblings to be posted here soon!
